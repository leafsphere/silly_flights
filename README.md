# silly_flights

Are you a broke college student? Have you ever wondered when the heck flight prices drop, and if there is such thing as an *optimal time* to splurge on tickets to see your long distance partner? This started off as an obsessive screenshotting extravaganza that involved opening Google Flights, searching up the desired flight, and copy + pasting the price history graphs of the exact same flight path on the same day of the week but also for the weeks before and after the desired date. That information still resides in my initial mess of a Google Docs file, but I've decided that it would be a shame of me as a data scientist and MS Candidate to keep eyeballing everything instead of just making my own graphs in R, so now I've regretfully taken it to the next level by fiddling with R code and making this a more official-looking data science project. 

# [3/5/24 Update]

Happy ending. Ticket is purchased!
